Things to keep in mind while pushing for a pull request
- implement one complete feature before putting in a pull request
- we will be using camel case for the function names
- function and variable names should be expressive and not of the for (a ,b, c, newA etc.)
- each function should have a single responsibility and should not do multiple things
- functions should follow open-closed principle
